<h3> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.
Itâ€™s an ability to monitor your own emotions as well as the emotions of others, to distinguish between and label different emotions correctly, and to use emotional information to guide your thinking and behaviour and influence that of others.

<h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
Intelligence is measured in a quotient called IQ - person's intelligence level. It's different from a measure of your ability to control your emotions which is called EQ.

<h3>Why is it important? </h3>
It can be helpful to recognise the feelings of others, understand their emotions, and utilise that understanding to relate to others more effectively (empathy). Build relationships, relate to others in social situations, lead, negotiate conflict, and work as part of a team.
