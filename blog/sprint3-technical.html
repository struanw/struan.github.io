        <h2> Sprint 3 -technical blog on Javascript and the DOM</h2>


<h3>Analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</h3>
    
   <h5> HTML is like a like a text you can write on a plain piece of paper and CSS is the artists tool belt you have to change the presentation.
    </h5>

<h3>Explain control flow and loops.</h3>
    <h5>Control flow is like the order in which instructions are carried out. a loop is used to repeat a specific block of instructions. Baking something is an example of control flow and loops in everyday life.
        you prepare a bunch of ingredient in a set order. Some times you have to repeat a process (a loop) and check that it is at the consistence or if its cooked. Like whipping cream till its just write of checking on cookies as it cooks.
         </h5>

<h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h3>
<h5>
The DOM represents the current content of the page. Through Devtools you can access information/data that you otherwise, could not as just a user viewing or using (clicking/inputting) a web page. Not only can you use it to change styling of colour and text, you can move items around the page to look at layout. More detail can be obtained by looking at things like how many clicks, who were the users, what outputs arrived from using page. Also things like speed to load and the ability to optimise the page.
</h5>

<h3>Accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
<h5>An array (list) and is written as a list of values between square brackets. You access by specifying which value you require in that array.
The first index of an array is zero, not one. So the first element is retrieved with listOfNumbers[0].


You can access object properties in two ways:
objectName.propertyName
objectName["propertyName"]
</h5>

<h3> 
    Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>

<h5>Like in maths a function is a tool/expression to vary a quantity depending on another quantity. They will return some value. They are useful implementing an instruction based on a user input like what could happen once a user enters info into a page.
</h5>
