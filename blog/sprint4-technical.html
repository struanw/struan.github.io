<h2>Problem solving and pseudocode</h2>

<h5>I got blocked on a problem when I needed to check individual indexes of the array.
I could draw on paper what I wanted to achieve but not write it as a function. I needed help from the tutor and plenty of google. it was incredibly frustrating because the kata had decent length time bank, so the time pressure makes it hard to think outside of the current problem blinders
I learn that you have to re-practice old techniques, you need to take breaks that change your through pattern and that you have to move on and complete other tasks.</h5>

<h5>I feel I solved a problem to find an average from an array in a elegant way. It is very handy to understand this. I new visually what I wanted, so I could see the idea in my head. So clear thought process.</h5>


<h4>Confidence on using problem solving techniques and process to work on javascript problems.</h4>

<h5>Pseudocode  - Confidence with using this is vastly different to confidence in success using this technique. I am confident to use pseudocode, but don't believe I am particular good at covering it into code.
Again Im confident/happy to use ‘Trying something,’ but definitely not skilled at it.
The Rubber ducky method; not confident with this and feel I need to give this a go because I feel this shows how clearly you understand what you are working on.
Reading error messages and Console.logging; not confident, I feel like I have a lot of room for development but not confident at the moment.
Googling, Asking your peers for help, Asking coaches for help are the easier methods to solving problems, I feel.</h5>
