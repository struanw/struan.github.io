        <h2> Sprint 5 - Cultural blog on Reflection </h2>


 <H4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</H4>
 <h5>It is difficult to write about yourself and post to strangers.</h5>
 <h5>How easy it can be for the mind to wonder during meditation.</h5>
 <h5>I was easily fustrated by road blocks in my work, thus making the time pressure more obvious.</h5>

<H4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </H4>
<h5>That I need to put more focus on A “growth mindset.” I need to see failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as growth and for stretching our existing abilities.</h5>

<H4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </H4>
<h5>Not letting your mind wonder. Maybe changing the blogs into our own words, rather than copying the first thing in google. </h5>

<H4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </H4>
<h5>So that students are employable straight from graduatuon. It is often said that students directly from study courses do not have the human skills required for the work place.</h5>


<H4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer. </H4>
<h5>Not for all of it. I see benefit in understanding the way people learn. I think some of the core had very closed or irrelevant questions. I think focus on indusrty, or types of people could be helpful and managment techniques. </h5>
<h5>More broken down quiz like questions or more practice on just sectins of code would be beneficial. </h5>
