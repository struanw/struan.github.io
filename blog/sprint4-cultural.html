        <h2> Sprint 4 - Cultural blog on Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset </h2>


<h5>Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, is the ability of the brain to change throughout an individual's life.</h5>
    
   <h5> It may not be easy and it will likely take sustained effort, but we have the ability to “remodel” our brains at any age in ways that can help us to function more effectively. Help through dealing with anxiety, ADHD, OCD depression and stroke recovery.</h5>
   <h5>It benefits people in: </h5>    
   <h5>&bull;Recovery from brain events like strokes. </h5>
    <h5>&bull; Recovery from traumatic brain injuries.</h5>
    <h5>&bull;Losing function in one area may enhance functions in other areas </h5>
    <h5>&bull; Enhanced memory abilities.</h5>
    <h5>&bull; Wide range of enhanced cognitive abilities.</h5>
    <h5>&bull; More effective learning.</h5>

    <h5> 
            A number of studies have linked meditation practice to differences in cortical thickness or density of gray matterHis results suggest that long-term or short-term practice of meditation results in different levels of activity in brain regions associated with such qualities as attention, anxiety, depression, fear, anger, and the ability of the body to heal itself. These functional changes may be caused by changes in the physical structure of the brain.

<h4>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit </h4>
<h5>It is positive and supports that for learning new content can be in what some would considered later than usual to learn new things.
</h5>

<h4> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h4>
<h5>
        Intermittent fasting increases synaptic adaptation, promotes neuron growth, improve overall cognitive function, and decreases the risk of neurodegenerative disease.
        Traveling: exposes your brain to novel stimuli and new environments, opening up new pathways and activity in the brain.
        Using mnemonic devices: memory training can enhance connectivity in the prefrontal parietal network and prevent some age-related memory loss.
        Learning a musical instrument: may increase connectivity between brain regions and help form new neural networks.
        Non-dominant hand exercises: can form new neural pathways and strengthen the connectivity between neurons.
        Reading fiction: increases and enhances connectivity in the brain.
        Expanding your vocabulary: activates the visual and auditory processes as well as memory processing.
        Creating artwork: enhances connectivity of the brain at rest
        Sleeping: encourages learning retention through the growth of the dendritic spines that act as connections between neurons and help transfer information across cells (Nguyen, 2016).

<h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>

<h4> Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h4>

<h5>Growth mindset: the understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed.
        A “growth mindset” thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as growth and for stretching our existing abilities.  </h5>


       <h4> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
       <h5>No. I believed you can learn at later ages through mindset, but didn't know there was a term for</h5>
        
      
       <h5> Positive affirmation will be the way to intergrate growth midset into my learning journey </h5>
