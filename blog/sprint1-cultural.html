        <h3> Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration </h3>


        <h5>Core Personal Values -Evidence from feedback</h5>

        My November 2018 decision to stop working at a job that I did not enjoy to pursue a new career. I weighed up the decisions with help from family and close friends. I made choices based on inside from friends and family along with self reflection and research. I looked at what would come next after quitting and also what career I would enjoy for a long time with career development. A close friend was able assist with growing the thought of a job in the tech industry. There were obvious consequences like a sudden decrease in income, but these were easily over come by the future possibilities of job satisfaction and growth. I would say my culture has allowed me to always be prepared, so that I can weigh up the risks of ethical decisions and make good choices, adapting to the outcomes.
        
        
        <h5>Strengths and limitations - Evidence from models</h5>
        
        An ethical decision had to be made when quitting previous job. I weighed up the values over time with help from friends and family and looking at what the outcomes could be. This can be shown through a Myers Briggs test I completed online. I was allocated a Debaters personality. Playing the devil’s advocate helps people with the Debater personality type to not only develop a better sense of others’ reasoning, but a better understanding of opposing ideas – since Debaters are the ones arguing them.
        I am very analytical, I believe this will assist me in my learning journey.
        In my previous job there were many times where I was trying to work productively with others, but there was tension from other staff who wanted to do things there way against standard practice. 
        Strategies I used were making sure the rest of the team followed the rules and picked up the slack. This technique was/is only effective short term, as people burn out. Other strategies I would try now would be to console more with management (although management was lacking).
